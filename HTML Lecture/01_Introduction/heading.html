        Headings in HTML:
        There are six levels of headings in HTML, from <h1> (largest) to <h6> (smallest). These elements define headings and subheadings for sections of your document.
        Each heading tag is a block element, meaning it takes up the full width and starts on a new line.
        -->

        <!-- <h1> is the largest heading, typically used for the main title of the page or section -->
        <h1>First Heading</h1>

        <!-- <h2> is used for subheadings or secondary titles under the main heading -->
        <h2>Second Heading</h2>

        <!-- <h3> is a smaller heading, often used for subsections under <h2> -->
        <h3>Third Heading</h3>

        <!-- <h4> continues the heading hierarchy, used for sub-sections under <h3> -->
        <h4>Fourth Heading</h4>

        <!-- <h5> is smaller still and can be used for even further breakdown of content -->
        <h5>Fifth Heading</h5>

        <!-- <h6> is the smallest heading and is usually used for fine details or lowest-level sections -->
        <h6>Sixth Heading</h6>
