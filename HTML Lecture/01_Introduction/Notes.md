#### **HTML Structure**
---

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create webpages. Here’s a simple structure of an HTML document:

```html
<!-- This is a comment. It doesn't appear on the webpage. -->
<html>
    <head>
        <title>HTML Intro</title> <!-- The title displayed in the browser tab -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Content visible to the user goes here -->
    </body>
</html>
```

- **`<html>`**: The root element of the HTML document.
- **`<head>`**: Contains metadata like the title of the page.
- **`<title>`**: The webpage’s title shown on the browser tab.
- **`<body>`**: Contains the content visible on the webpage.

#### **Comments in HTML:**

Comments are used to explain code. They are ignored by the browser.

```html
<!-- This is a comment. It does not affect the webpage. -->
```

**Shortcut:** Use `Ctrl + /` (Windows) or `Cmd + /` (Mac) to quickly comment code in many editors.

#### **Headings in HTML:**

Headings are used to organize the content of a page. There are six heading levels, from `<h1>` (largest) to `<h6>` (smallest).

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1> <!-- Used for the main title -->
<h2>Subheading</h2> <!-- Used for sections -->
<h3>Smaller Heading</h3> <!-- Subsection -->
<h4>, <h5>, <h6> for smaller sections -->
```

- **`<h1>`**: Main heading, largest.
- **`<h2>` to `<h6>`**: Subheadings in decreasing size.

Headings help structure content and are important for SEO.

#### **Note:**

- **HTML** is the structure of a webpage.
- **`<html>`**, **`<head>`**, and **`<body>`** are core tags.
- **Comments** explain code but don’t appear on the page.
- **Headings** help organize content for better readability and SEO.
