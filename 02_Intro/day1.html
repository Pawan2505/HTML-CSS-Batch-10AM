    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a language used for creating web pages. 
    Elements or tags in HTML are not case-sensitive. You can write tag names in either uppercase or lowercase.

    <!-- 
    Headings in HTML are used to structure content, from largest to smallest.
    
    Types of Headings:
    - <h1>: Largest heading
    - <h2>: Second largest heading
    - <h3>: Medium heading
    - <h4>: Smaller heading
    - <h5>: Even smaller heading
    - <h6>: Smallest heading
    -->
    
    <h1>First Heading</h1>
    <h2>Second Heading</h2>
    <h3>Third Heading</h3>
    <h4>Fourth Heading</h4>
    <h5>Fifth Heading</h5>
    <h6>Sixth Heading</h6>

    Block-Level Elements:
    1. They take up the full width of their parent container.
    2. Block elements start on a new line.

    <!-- Example of block-level elements (headings) already displayed above -->

    <!-- 

    Inline-Level Elements:
    1. They only take up as much width as necessary, based on their content.
    2. If there is available space next to a previous inline element, the new inline element will appear next to it.
